# Often it's a good idea to do inline disables rather that repo-wide in this file.
# Example of inline Dockerfile rules:
# hadolint ignore=DL3018
# RUN apk add --no-cache git

# or just ignore rules repo-wide
ignored:
  - DL3006 #image pin versions
  - DL3008 #apt pin versions
  - DL3018 #apk add pin versions
